Server Operators:
=================
You can enable redirected downloads on your server by using the sv_download_server cvar and pointing to a URL of your choosing.
sv_download_server is the base of the URL that contains your custom files, the client will append both fs_game and the filename to the end of this value.
For example, if you have sv_download_server set to "http://cake.sourceforge.net/", fs_game is "base", and the client is missing "test.pak", it will attempt to download from the URL "http://cake.sourceforge.net/base/test.pak"

Server operators can also provide a filelist, which will tell the engine exactly which files to grab first, before checking for missing items one-by-one.
Inside of the fs_game folder, a server operator would put a .filelist file. The .filelist would then be filled with the files of that specific mod.
An example of the inside of a filelist:
maps\q2dm1.bsp
sounds\env\ambien06.wav
models\weapons\w_cactus.md2
Any listing in that file will be downloaded even if it's required or not.

Server operators who are concerned about potential "leeching" from their HTTP servers from other game servers can make use of the HTTP_REFERER that the game sets which is "quake2://{SERVER_IP}:{SERVER_PORT}".
For, example, Apache's mod_rewrite can restrict access based on HTTP_REFERER.


Clients:
========
Clients should not have to do anything special, as by default HTTP downloading is enabled.
If a client requires use of a proxy to get out, then set cl_http_proxy to the proxy required.


Server CVars:
=============
sv_download_server
specifies the URL clients should use for HTTP downloading.
URL must begin with a 'http://' prefix and end with a trailing slash. Default value is empty.


Client CVars:
=============
cl_http_downloads
Enables HTTP downloads, if server advertises download URL.
Default value is 1 (enabled).

cl_http_filelists
When a first file is about to be downloaded from HTTP server, send a filelist request, and download any additional files specified in the filelist.
Filelists provide a ‘pushing’ mechanism for the server operator to make sure all clients download complete set of data for the particular mod, instead of requesting files one-by-one.
Default value is 1 (request filelists).

cl_http_max_connections
Maximum number of simultaneous connections to the HTTP server.
Default value is 2.

cl_http_proxy
HTTP proxy server to use for downloads.
Default value is empty (direct connection).
